const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which you determine the tools and technology needed."
const design = "This is the third step, in which architects and developers draw up advanced technical specifications they need to create the software to requirements."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which developers code based on the product specifications and requirements agreed upon in the previous stages."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which expert testers verify the product's functions to make sure it performs according to the requirments analysis document."
